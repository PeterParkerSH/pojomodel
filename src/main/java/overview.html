Welcome to the documentation of the PojoApplication. The application provides a rest interface to store the class
structure of Pojos (Plain Old Java Objects). It includes inheritance and attributes of Pojos. Generics and arrays are
not considered. The Pojos can be uploaded as .jar file or as .class file. The tools to handle such files can be found in
{@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.binaryreading}. To store the data a neo4j graph database is used. The access to the database is configured in the
"application.yaml". The database access occurs via repositories. The repositories are located in the package
{@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.repository}. The model to store the data structure for the Pojos can be
found in {@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.pojomodel}, where an UML diagram is also placed. A service layer can be found in
{@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.rest.service}. Each service has a corresponding rest controller in
{@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.rest.controller}. There a some special data structures for providing the data
via json in the rest API located in {@link de.fh.kiel.advancedjava.pojoapplication.rest.restmodel}.
